			<h1>What is Benin City?</h1>
			<p>Formerly the most important city of the Edo Kingdom of Benin, Benin City is the capital city of southern Nigeria's Edo State.

				<br><br>
				Benin City is one of 17 cities and towns in Edo State, is it's capital, and is also the largest city there.
				<br><br>
				It's also the 4th largest city in Nigeria, and has a population of 1.78 million as of 2021.
				<br><br>
				Benin City is often overshadowed and confused with the country of Benin, which is also in West Africa, more specifically
				right beside the west of Nigeria.
				<br><br>
				It also used to be a part of the British Empire from 1897 to 1960, which is likely what subjected them to
				English and other characteristics of the modern European world.

			<h1>What to expect?</h1>
			<p>Benin City and Edo State are just like a large amount of other African countries wherein they have
				a tropical savanna type climate.
				<br></br>
				In fact, a whopping 65% of Africa is in a savanna climate, with the only difference being that Benin City 
				is only borderlined by tropical savannas.
				<br></br>
				The rest of BC has a tropical monsoon climate, with high temperatures, plenty precipitation, and only small differences 
				between yearly temperature ranges.
				 </p>

			<p>
				Benin City's annual temperatures range normally from 67° to 88° Fahrenheit, rarely dipping under or over the
				approximate maximum values. 
				<br></br>
				While the constant heat is pestering, the constant rainfall eases the temperatures.
				Although, the heat is never truly staved off which is a quality of many African countries. 
				<br></br>
				One thing that remains constant other than the heat is also the partial cloudiness, 
				which also helps relieve the varying heat.

			<h1>People</h1>
			<p>In Benin City, and more largely the Edo State, there are a total of 5 major ethnic groups. The most prominent are the Edo
				(Binis), making up over a whopping 54% of the population. Then there are the Etsako, Esans, Owans and Akoko Edos.
				With Benin City being the capital of Edo State, nearly all of their ethnicites originate from it. 
			</p>
			<p>The official language of Benin City, also being the official language of instruction, is English. Although, nearly all of
				Benin City's inhabitants will learn the language associated with their tribe, the most common being Edo, Igarra, and
				Afernai (Etsako & Akoko Edo) just to name a few.

				Pertaining to religion, most of Benin City's inhabitants are predominantly Christian. Second to them are those that are
				Muslim, and finally a minority of the population practice tradition religions such as Yoruba.
